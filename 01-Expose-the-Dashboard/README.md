# Expose the Dashboard

## Set Your Cluster's IP in a Variable

Throughout these lessons we'll be using sslip.io to dynamically map a hostname to a local IP address. The IP address of my node is different from yours, so whenever possible, I'll reference a URL like: `dashboard.traefik.$CLUSTERIP.sslip.io`. For examples with `kubectl` and `curl`, this will work if you set the variable `CLUSTERIP` to the address of your cluster. For pages loaded in the browser you'll have to make that substitution yourself.

> **PRO TIP:** If you don't know the IP address of your cluster, you can look in your `kubectl` config file.

```bash
grep server: $KUBECONFIG
      server: "https://10.68.0.70:6443"

# bash
export CLUSTERIP=10.68.0.70

# fish
set -x CLUSTERIP 10.68.0.70
```

## Put Yourself Into Traefik Proxy's Namespace

K3s places Traefik Proxy into the `kube-system` namespace. If you installed with Helm, it might be in `traefik-system` or a namespace of your own choosing. You can either append the namespace to all of the commands below, or you can set that namespace as part of your context.

```bash
➤ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace kube-system
Context "demo" modified.
```

## Create the Service

The port for the Traefik Proxy dashboard is not included in the default `traefik` service created when Helm installs Traefik. We need this as a target for our Ingress, so we'll create a new Service.

```bash
kubectl expose deploy/traefik -n kube-system --port=9000 --target-port=9000 --name=traefik-dashboard
```

## Create the Ingress

With the Service created, we can create an Ingress that exposes the dashboard outside of the cluster.

```bash
kubectl create ingress traefik-dashboard --rule="dashboard.traefik.$CLUSTERIP.sslip.io/*=traefik-dashboard:9000"
```

## Visit the Dashboard

```bash
➤ curl -si http://dashboard.traefik.$CLUSTERIP.sslip.io/dashboard/ | head -n 1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Visit the dashboard in a browser. Look at the Routers under the HTTP section and find our Ingress. Which entrypoints is it listening on?

## Add the Annotations

If you don't specify an entrypoint, Traefik will answer for the Ingress on all entrypoints. This usually doesn't make sense, since we have different entrypoints for a reason. To control this behavior, we'll add an annotation that tells Traefik the exact entrypoint from which we want this Ingress to be served.

```bash
kubectl annotate ingress traefik-dashboard traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints=web
```

Reload the Routers page. Where is the entrypoint for the Ingress now?

What other applications are listening? Can you access any of them with a browser?
